# Regex Tutorial



## Summary

A tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does. 

For example ``` ([A-Za-z0-9-]+) ```

## Regex Components

### Anchors

In regular expressions, an anchor is a symbol that matches a position in the input string rather than a specific character. There are two types of anchors:

*Start-of-line (SOL) anchor: The SOL anchor ```(^)``` matches the position at the beginning of a line. For example, the regular expression "```^The```" will match "The" at the start of a line, but it will not match "The" if it appears later in a line.

*End-of-line (EOL) anchor: The EOL anchor ```($)``` matches the position at the end of a line. For example, the regular expression "```end$```" will match "end" at the end of a line, but it will not match "end" if it appears earlier in a line.

Here are some examples of how anchors can be used in regular expressions:

To match a string that starts with "The" and ends with "end", you can use the regular expression "```^The.*end$```". The ```^``` anchor will match the start of the line, and the ```$``` anchor will match the end of the line.

To match a string that starts with a digit, you can use the regular expression "```^[0-9]```". The ```^``` anchor will match the start of the line, and the character class ```[0-9]``` will match any digit.

To match a string that ends with a whitespace character, you can use the regular expression "```.[ \t\r\n]$```". The ```.``` pattern will match any number of characters, and the character class ```[ \t\r\n]``` will match a whitespace character. The ```$``` anchor will match the end of the line.
